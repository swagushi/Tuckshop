The Tuckshop brand can be described as a non profit as this project can be picked up and used by anyone with no legal reprecussion. This project was created with in mind of the schools who do not have a tuckshop system, if they desire they can use this as a blue print for their tuckshop system or use it to build upon and implement their own things.

To launch this project you must clone the reposotory in visual studio 2022 as I have not published this to azure or any other publishing websites, after cloning the repository type "update-database" into the Nuget Package Manager then run the project it will run with no diffculties. Then once the project is launched to access the pages you must register as a user or sign in with the admin login that is coded into the database. With the admin login you will be able to access the students page and edit and delete any of the entries
